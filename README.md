# Project-Prosper-Loan-Data-Analytic

## Outline ##
In this project, I have analyzed the dataset from [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com) which is a Peer to Peer Lending marketplace in United States of America, you can find more details [here](https://www.prosper.com/about).

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Understand the Dataset ##
This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This Loan Data from Prosper is last updated on 03/11/2015 and you can click [ProsperLoan] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv) for more information about the dataset. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) is the data dictionary that is useful to understand the dataset.

## Installation ##
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project: 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas 
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

## Main Findings ##
The main findings of my exploratory analysis was determining what are the most important factor in increasing the confidence of the p2p lending organization to increase number of lender and also number of borrower. After some exploratory analysis, I have deduced that ProsperScore and Credit Grade are the most critical tool to increase number of lender and also number of borrower. Hence, my explanatory analysis was to determine the accuracy of the tools used. 

## Conclusion ##
In conclusion, the tools used are accurate and the organization should be confident to increase its number of lender and also number of borrower.
